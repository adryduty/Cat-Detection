# computer-vision-cat-project

In this project I trained a yolov5 for detecting my cat in my house. In order to distinguish among it and other objects (e.g. peluche cat, shoes, ...)
I built a training set with different images (so far 165: 55 original and 110 of augmentation with saturation and brightness). I'm going to increase this
data-set. You can find all the files you need in this repo.
